## Welcome to my webpage!

I have the privilege of directing the Teledia lab, a large, interdisciplinary lab involving PhD, Masters, and undergraduate students, staff, and affiliates researching interactive and explainable Sociotechnical Artificial Intelligence from a highly interdisciplinary perspective. Our team is highly collaborative, offering students many opportunities to explore new horizons as well as expand their impact by developing and then contributing their own unique expertise and research creations to numerous synergistic efforts.
